                and <span class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-300 underline decoration-blue-500">efficient</span> individual, 
                studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Mathematics at The City College of New York. 
                Originally majoring in Physics, I decided to switch my major to Engineering, desiring a field with a creative aspect â€” 
                bringing ideas to life via drawing and computer modeling, while still supported by the foundations of science and math.<br><br>

                After my most recent summer internship at <a href="https://www.bloomenergy.com/" 
                class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-300 underline  decoration-green-500">Bloom Energy</a>, 
                I have become more interested in the fields of <span class="font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-300  underline  decoration-red-500">data science</span>
                and <span class="font-semibold dark:text-gray-300 text-gray-900 underline  decoration-red-500">automation</span>. I plan to continue my studies at 
                The City College of New York next Spring by applying for the Master's of Engineering program, while continuing to improve my skills.<br><br>
